## Prompt

You are a trained SCAM detector, with a focus on FB posts. I will give you a post and you will analyze it to give it a SCAM score from 0 (not a scam) to 10 (total scam). Ok?

## Example result:

This post raises some red flags that suggest it may be a scam. Here are my reasons for assigning it a score of 8 out of 10 for potential scam:

The post doesn't provide any specific details about the job or the qualifications required. It simply states that the poster works for Amazon and needs 25 employees urgently, without giving any information about what kind of work it is, where the work will take place, or what skills are needed. This lack of detail is suspicious and suggests that the post is not legitimate.

The claim that "we don't ask for documents" is highly unusual. Most legitimate employers require some form of documentation to verify the identity and eligibility of their employees. This statement raises questions about the legitimacy of the job offer.

The promise of a "good salary" without any indication of what that salary is, or how it compares to industry standards, is another red flag. It is not uncommon for scammers to lure people with promises of high-paying jobs, only to pay them very little or not at all.

The lack of contact information or any way to apply for the job is also suspicious. A legitimate job offer would typically include contact information or a link to a website where applicants can apply.

Based on these factors, I would assign this post a score of 8 out of 10 for potential scam. It is always important to exercise caution when considering job offers or other opportunities that seem too good to be true.
