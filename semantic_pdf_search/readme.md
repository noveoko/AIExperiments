Local PDF Semantic Search with OllamaThis project provides a Python script that scans a directory for PDF files, extracts their text content, and uses a local Ollama instance to create semantic embeddings. It builds a searchable index, allowing you to perform natural language queries to find the most relevant PDF documents on your computer.FeaturesRecursive PDF Scanning: Automatically finds all .pdf files within a specified directory and its subdirectories.Text Extraction: Uses the PyMuPDF library to efficiently extract text from each page of a PDF.Intelligent Chunking: Splits extracted text into meaningful paragraphs to create focused embeddings.Local Embeddings: Leverages your own Ollama instance to generate embeddings, ensuring your data remains completely private.Semantic Search: Finds documents based on the meaning of your query, not just keyword matching.Command-Line Interface: Easy-to-use CLI for both indexing your files and performing searches.PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed and running:Python 3.8+: If you don't have it, download it from python.org.Ollama: Download and install Ollama from ollama.com.An Ollama Embedding Model: You need a model to generate the embeddings. We recommend mxbai-embed-large as it provides excellent performance. To pull the model, run the following command in your terminal:ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
Running Ollama Instance: Make sure the Ollama application is running in the background before you execute the script.InstallationClone or Download:Save the pdf_search.py script to a new directory on your computer.Create requirements.txt:In the same directory, create a file named requirements.txt and add the following content:PyMuPDF
requests
numpy
tqdm
Install Dependencies:Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run:pip install -r requirements.txt
How to UseThe script operates in two main modes: indexing and searching.1. Build the Search Index (--index)This is the first step. The script needs to scan your PDFs and create the pdf_search_index.json file.To index your entire home directory (default):python pdf_search.py --index
To index a specific folder:Use the --dir flag to specify a path. This is highly recommended to save time.# Example for Windows
python pdf_search.py --index --dir "C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\Work"

# Example for macOS/Linux
python pdf_search.py --index --dir "/home/youruser/reports"
The script will ask for confirmation before starting. This process can be lengthy depending on the number of PDFs.2. Search the Index (--search)Once the index is built, you can perform searches.Run the script with the --search flag, followed by your query in quotes:python pdf_search.py --search "summary of the 2023 financial report"
```bash
python pdf_search.py --search "what were the key findings about machine learning models"
The script will return the top 5 most relevant PDF files, along with the specific text chunk that matched your query and a similarity score.ConfigurationYou can modify the following constants at the top of the pdf_search.py script:DEFAULT_SEARCH_DIR: Change the default directory to scan if the --dir flag isn't used.OLLAMA_ENDPOINT: The URL for your Ollama API endpoint (defaults to http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings).OLLAMA_MODEL: The name of the embedding model you want to use.INDEX_FILE: The name of the file where the search index is stored.
