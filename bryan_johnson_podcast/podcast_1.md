# Compact Health Guide: Tips and Advice from the *"Don't Die"* Podcast

*Based on insights from the "Don't Die" podcast hosted by Brian, Kate Tolo, and Dr. Mike Min.*

A concise health guide with practical tips and advice for optimizing health and longevity.

---

## 1. Prioritize Prevention Over Cure

**Tip:** Most chronic diseases (80–90% of ER visits) are preventable through lifestyle choices.
**Action:** Focus on a nutrient-dense diet, regular exercise, and stress management.
**Why:** Emergency medicine often deals with consequences of poor habits. Proactive health reduces the need for urgent care.

---

## 2. Advocate for Yourself in Healthcare

**Tip:** Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to research symptoms and medical procedures.
**Action:** Before/during an ER visit, input your symptoms into an AI to get potential diagnoses and tests. Share with providers.
**Why:** The chaotic U.S. healthcare system may overlook details. Self-advocacy helps ensure proper care.

---

## 3. Optimize Creatine Use for Health Benefits

**Tip:** Creatine supports cognitive and metabolic health, not just muscle growth.
**Action:**

* **Dosage:** \~5g/day (or 0.1g/kg body weight). Vegans may need more.
* **No Loading Needed:** Daily 5g over 3–4 weeks is effective.
* **Monitor:** Slight rise in blood creatinine is normal.

**Why:** Despite recent doubts about muscle benefits, creatine remains effective for cognition and recovery.

---

## 4. Cultivate Body Awareness

**Tip:** Learn to interpret your body's signals.
**Action:**

* Track heart rate, sleep, energy levels via wearables (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch).
* Pair subjective feelings with objective data.

**Why:** Early detection of changes prevents bigger issues. Awareness discourages unhealthy choices.

---

## 5. Prioritize Sleep for Cognitive and Physical Performance

**Tip:** Sleep fuels creativity, courage, and productivity.
**Action:**

* Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep nightly.
* Use trackers to monitor sleep scores.
* Avoid alcohol, late nights, poor diet.

**Why:** As shown by Andrej Karpathy’s sleep experiments, better sleep improves work and resilience.

---

## 6. Be Skeptical of Headline Health News

**Tip:** Don't jump to conclusions based on small studies.
**Action:**

* Investigate study details (sample size, duration, etc.).
* Stick with well-established practices unless compelling evidence arises.

**Why:** Media often misrepresents findings. Long-term evidence is more reliable.

---

## 7. Slow Aging Through Consistent Habits

**Tip:** Track biological aging to assess your health protocol.
**Action:**

* Follow comprehensive protocols (e.g., Blueprint).
* Regularly measure biomarkers.

**Why:** Slowing aging (e.g., <0.5 years biologically/year) delays decline. Lifestyle and genetics affect outcomes.

---

## 8. Avoid Toxins and Processed Foods

**Tip:** Processed/restaurant food may contain harmful ingredients.
**Action:**

* Cook at home with whole, organic ingredients.
* Vet restaurant sourcing—even “healthy” spots.

**Why:** The body tolerates bad food briefly, but chronic exposure causes disease and decline.

---

## 9. Embrace Measurement for Empowerment

**Tip:** Objective data supports better decisions.
**Action:**

* Start simple: step count, sleep duration.
* Progress to advanced tools: brain scans, biomarker panels.

**Why:** Feedback loops connect how you feel with actionable insights. Data reveals hidden impairments.

---

## 10. Invest in Your Intelligence

**Tip:** Health boosts cognitive and emotional intelligence.
**Action:**

* Combine physical health with learning and emotional regulation.
* Use AI to broaden perspectives and spot blind spots.

**Why:** In an AI-driven world, augmenting human intelligence through health and tech is crucial.

---

## Final Note

The *"Don't Die"* philosophy promotes proactive, evidence-based health to extend and improve life.
Start small: measure one metric (e.g., sleep), adopt one habit (e.g., 5g creatine/day), and grow from there.
**Consistency and curiosity are key.**
