This guide covers the end-to-end process of setting up an Azure DevOps environment, securing it, and testing your knowledge with practical scenarios.
Part 1: Step-by-Step Tutorial
Phase 1: Create the Organization
The Organization is the top-level container that mirrors your company or business unit.
 * Sign in: Go to dev.azure.com and sign in with your Microsoft account (or Microsoft Entra ID / corporate account).
 * Create New: Select + New Organization on the left sidebar.
 * Configure Basics:
   * Name: Choose a unique name (e.g., Contoso-Dev).
   * Region: Select the region closest to your users (e.g., West Europe) to minimize latency.
   * CAPTCHA: Complete the verification and click Continue.
 * Wait for Provisioning: Azure will provision your instance. You are now the Organization Owner (a member of the Project Collection Administrators group).
Phase 2: Configure Organization Security Policies
Before adding projects, harden the organization level.
 * Navigate: Click Organization settings (bottom left gear icon).
 * Security > Policies:
   * Third-party application access via OAuth: Off (unless explicitly needed).
   * SSH authentication: On (typical for developers using Git).
   * Allow public projects: Off (Crucial for enterprise security to prevent accidental data leaks).
 * Users:
   * Go to General > Users.
   * Add users here first. Assign Access Levels:
     * Basic: For engineers (needs a license/subscription).
     * Stakeholder: For PMs/Management (free, limited features).
Phase 3: Create and Configure a Project
Projects isolate teams, repositories, and pipelines.
 * Create: Click + New Project on the organization home page.
 * Details:
   * Name: Web-App-Migration
   * Visibility: Private (Only members you add can see it).
   * Advanced:
     * Version Control: Git (Standard).
     * Work Item Process: Agile or Scrum (depending on your team's workflow).
 * Click Create.
Phase 4: Set Project Permissions & Teams
Do not assign permissions to individuals. Use Groups.
 * Go to Project Settings (bottom left inside the project).
 * General > Permissions:
   * Review the default groups: Readers, Contributors, Project Administrators.
 * Create a Custom Team (Recommended):
   * Go to General > Teams > New Team.
   * Name: Frontend-Devs.
   * Add users to this team.
 * Assign Permissions to the Team:
   * Go back to Permissions > Contributors.
   * Add the Frontend-Devs team as a member of the Contributors group.
   * Why? This inherits all standard developer permissions (push code, edit work items) without giving Admin rights.
Part 2: 5-Question Quiz
Q1. You need to prevent anyone in the company from accidentally making a project visible to the entire internet. Where do you configure this?
A) Project Settings > Permissions
B) Organization Settings > Policies
C) Project Settings > Overview
D) Pipeline Settings
Q2. Which default Security Group should you assign to a Lead Developer who needs to manage permissions and repositories for a specific project, but should not change billing or delete the Organization?
A) Project Collection Administrators
B) Organization Owner
C) Project Administrators
D) Contributors
Q3. True or False: If you grant a user "Stakeholder" access level, they can view private repositories and edit code.
(Select one)
Q4. You are setting up a project for a Contractor. You want them to only see the specific project they are assigned to, not the list of all users in the Organization. What feature should you enable in Organization Settings?
A) Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects
B) Allow public projects
C) Enforce SSH authentication
D) Third-party application access
Q5. A user is a member of two groups: "Contributors" (Allow Write) and "Contractors" (Deny Write). What is their effective permission?
A) Allow (Permissions are additive)
B) Deny (Deny explicitly overrides Allow)
C) Allow (Closest group wins)
D) It depends on the alphabet order of the group name
Part 3: Problem Set
Problem 1: The "walled garden" scenario
Scenario: You are a consultant for a bank. They want to create a project for an external vendor. The vendor must access the repository and board only for Project X. They must not be able to see Project Y, nor should they be able to create new repositories in Project X.
Task: Describe the configuration steps.
> Solution hint:
>  * Enable "Limit user visibility..." in Org Settings.
>  * Add vendor to Project X only.
>  * Create a custom Group "Vendor-Restricted" in Project X.
>  * Set "Create Repository" permission to Deny for this group.
>  * Add vendor to this group.
> 
Problem 2: The accidental deletion protection
Scenario: A junior developer recently deleted a critical Azure DevOps project by mistake. You need to ensure that only the CTO and the DevOps Lead can delete projects. Everyone else (including standard Project Admins) should be prevented from doing so.
Task: Which specific permission needs to be changed and where?
> Solution hint:
>  * Go to Organization Settings > Permissions.
>  * Select the Project Collection Administrators group (ensure only CTO/Lead are here).
>  * For other groups (or a custom group containing Project Admins), set "Delete team project" to Deny.
> 
Problem 3: Conditional Access
Scenario: Your company requires that no developer can access Azure DevOps Repositories unless they are on the corporate VPN (IP Range 203.0.113.0/24).
Task: Explain how to achieve this using Azure DevOps in conjunction with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
> Solution hint:
>  * This is configured in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Portal), not directly inside Azure DevOps.
>  * Create a Conditional Access Policy.
>  * Target Application: Azure DevOps.
>  * Condition: Location (Exclude Trusted IP 203.0.113.0/24).
>  * Access Control: Block Access (for all other locations).
> 
Quiz Answer Key
 * B (Organization Settings > Policies)
 * C (Project Administrators)
 * False (Stakeholders have no access to Code/Repos in private projects).
 * A (Limit user visibility...)
 * B (Deny always wins in Azure DevOps permissions).
Would you like me to generate a specific JSON template or script to automate the creation of these projects and groups?
